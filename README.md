# Self Service Group Privileged JIT Access with MIM 2016
The TLK Technology self service group privileged access tool developed in Microsoft Identity manager (MIM) 2016 is designed to meet the security requirements of companies that want to 
control and monitor limited access to Active Directory security groups with elevated rights in AD or in applications. It offers complete
self service administration to security administrators and a self service request process with email notification to end users. MIM 2016 already offers
a self service group management tool so adding this tool keeps all group management requests in one system with the added functionality
of Just-In-Time (JIT) access.
